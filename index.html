            <h3>Career</h3>
            <p>In the 1970s, Tata was given a managerial position in the Tata group.  In 1991, J. R. D. Tata stepped down as chairman of Tata Sons, naming him his successor. <br>
                During the 21 years Tata led the Tata Group, revenues grew over 40 times, and profit over 50 times. <br>
                 When he took over the company, sales overwhelmingly comprised commodity sales, but at the end of his tenure, the majority of sales came from brands. <br>
                  He had Tata Tea acquire Tetley, Tata Motors acquire Jaguar Land Rover, and Tata Steel acquire Corus. These acquisitions repositioned <br>
                   Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business, with over 65% of revenues coming from operations and sales internationally.[15]</p>
